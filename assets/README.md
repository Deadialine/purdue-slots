# Assets

Place Purdue-themed images here and update the URLs in `CONFIG.symbols` within `main.js` if you want to load locally (e.g., `assets/images/pete.png`).

Audio placeholders referenced by the game live in `assets/sounds/`:
- `win_small.mp3`
- `win_medium.mp3`
- `win_big.mp3`
- `champion_music.mp3`
- `slot_sound.mp3` (plays when a spin is triggered)

Drop your Purdue-spirited SFX/loops into that folder using the same filenames to enable celebratory audio.
